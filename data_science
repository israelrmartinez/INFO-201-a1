A.
1.	"Weapon of Math Destruction" are math-powered data models which encode human
 prejudice, misunderstanding, and bias into software systems that increasingly
 manage our lives. This means that mathematical systems that are intended to
 assist humans can be unintentionally harmful to a group of people and cause
 unfair disadvantages.
2.	An example of a weapon of math destruction is the teacher evaluation process
 which calculates a teacher’s score based on the test scores of their students
 and it determines whether their teaching skills are effective. This creates a
 bias against teachers in poor communities because the struggles of affect
 learning but aren’t calculated into the teachers score.
B.	The main research question of this paper is “when will gender parity be
reached among authors?” In the paper, they found that authorship regarding
females in Computer Science will not reach parity until the next century or
even longer. Also, they found a low number of cross-gender collaborations b
etween computer scientists.
