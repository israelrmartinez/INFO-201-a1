## Personal Life
* She was a British socialite and had a gift for combining art and
science.
* She had access to private tutors and intellectual individuals in society.

## Professional Contributions
* She "explored the ramifications of what a computer could do, writing about
the responsibility placed on the person programming the machine"
* In 1843, she published an academic paper "about the Babbage Analytical Engine
and added a section titled 'Notes,' where she described how the computer would
work, imagined its potential and wrote the first program."

## Obituary Quote
> _"The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate any
thing,” she wrote. “It can do whatever we know how to order it to
perform.”_

## My question
If I could ask Ada Lovelace one question, I would ask about how she must have
dealt with sexism in her personal life. Before marrying :ring: I could imagine how
many “men” felt insecure and therefore hasty if she was being herself.
